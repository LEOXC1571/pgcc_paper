	abstract = {Collaborative ﬁltering recommendation with implicit feedbacks (i.e., clicks, views, check-ins) has been gaining increasing attention in various real applications. Tagging information is the common resource to complement implicit feedbacks to assist collaborative ﬁltering recommendation. However, existing tag-aware recommendation methods still suffer from the problem of high dimension and sparsity of tagging information. They also fail to realize that recommendation is inherent a ranking-oriented optimization task. To this end, we propose a novel tag-aware recommendation framework by incorporating tag mapping scheme into ranking-based collaborative ﬁltering model, to boost ranking-oriented personalized recommendation performance. We ﬁrst build ranking-oriented optimization model based on Bayesian personalized ranking optimization criterion with matrix factorization, by leveraging implicit feedbacks to learn the latent feature vectors of users and items. Then, we propose an explicit-to-implicit feature mapping scheme, mapping the high-dimensional and sparse explicit tags (i.e., user-tag weighting matrix and item-tag weighting matrix) to low-dimensional and compact implicit features of uses and items. This could serve as the regularization constraint of latent features derived from implicit feedbacks. To further enhance recommendation performance, we also introduce users’ neighbor relationships to regularize user latent features based on manifold learning. Experiments on real-world recommendation datasets show that the proposed recommendation method outperformed competing methods on ranking-oriented recommendation performance.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01731},
	abstract = {In recent years, there are a large number of recommendation algorithms proposed in the literature, from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning algorithms. However, the concerns about how to standardize open source implementation of recommendation algorithms continually increase in the research community. In the light of this challenge, we propose a unified, comprehensive and efficient recommender system library called RecBole (pronounced as [rEk’boUl@r]), which provides a unified framework to develop and reproduce recommendation algorithms for research purpose. In this library, we implement 73 recommendation models on 28 benchmark datasets, covering the categories of general recommendation, sequential recommendation, context-aware recommendation and knowledge-based recommendation. We implement the RecBole library based on PyTorch, which is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Our library is featured in many aspects, including general and extensible data structures, comprehensive benchmark models and datasets, efficient GPU-accelerated execution, and extensive and standard evaluation protocols. We provide a series of auxiliary functions, tools, and scripts to facilitate the use of this library, such as automatic parameter tuning and break-point resume. Such a framework is useful to standardize the implementation and evaluation of recommender systems. The project and documents are released at https://recbole.io/.},

	abstract = {Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-ofthe-art for collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in GCNs — feature transformation and nonlinear activation — contribute little to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance.},

	abstract = {Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user’s (or an item’s) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect.},
